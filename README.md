# 🔐 Biometric Project – Face Recognition + Active Liveness Detection

A full-stack biometric authentication system using **face recognition** and **active liveness detection** (blink/head-move detection).  
It allows secure user registration, authentication, and real-time video-based verification via webcam or uploaded video.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Face Recognition** using embeddings and threshold-based matching.
- 👁️ **Active Liveness Detection** – Detects blinking and head movement to prevent spoofing.
- 📷 Webcam support + video upload processing.
- 🔒 **Encrypted storage** of biometric data.
- 🌐 **Full-stack architecture** – Backend API + frontend UI.
- 📜 Access logs for all authentication attempts.
